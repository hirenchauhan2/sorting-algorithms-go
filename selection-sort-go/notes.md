# Selection sort

- Its a sorting algorithm, its an in-place comparison based algorithm.
- Its has O(n<sup>2</sup>) time complexity for the worst case.
- Divide the array in 2 parts, one will be the sorted array and another will the unsorted array
- We will pick the smallest number in case of ascending sort from the unsorted array and append it to the sorted array
- Keep doing until there are no elements left in unsorted array
- In last you will have sorted array.
